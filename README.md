•	Fine-tuned a pre-trained MT5 model on a persian summarization dataset ([pn-summary](https://github.com/hooshvare/pn-summary)).

•	Used a [fined-tuned Pegasus model](https://github.com/alirezasalemi7/ARMAN) on the same dataset as the baseline.

•	Used Rouge, Bert-Score and new metric based on [NER](https://huggingface.co/HooshvareLab/bert-base-parsbert-ner-uncased) and Bert-Score as evaluation metrics.
